!!!! ðŸ‘‡ Patch notes V0.0.12 ðŸ‘‡!!!!!

Got bored, then I realised: my fps is ACCUAL FLIPPING DOG WATER. So. I did a setings rework.
!!âœ¨ New Features âœ¨!!
- new thingamabob for settings menu background so that you can see better you blind idiots.
- sHaDoWs (why the FLUCK DO THEY LOOK SO BAD BRO ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­)  
- added the following options to the settings menu:
    Anti-aliasing mode (None, FXAA, MSAA)
    Max FPS (No Max, 120, 60, 30)
    V-Sync (which i HIGHLY recommend for better FPS)
    Texture and Shadow Quality (which Shadow quality does not really work well)
    Post-Processing (which i have disabled for the time being, as i dont even know WhAT THE FLIP IT IS)
- When you click on Play as a team you are sent to a concept screen for online multiplayer

!! Bug Fixes ðŸª²!!
- funky ah sound delays fixed (good thing Alfredo never noticed it)

P.S. if you find bugs, STFU, i dont really care.
