Heyyy

launcher should be fixed now

!!!! Patch notes V0.0.7 !!!!!

!! New Features !!
- Added Mouse sensitivity via the settings menu
- Global variables (Esssentially your settings now auto-apply)
- Bug fixes (view below for more info)
- While Shadows super is popped, you have a goofy ah black ball trail. (bcause y not, yk?)
!! Bug Fixes !!
- A random flipping ball in the air will no longer appear, and will no longer shoot out black balls (yo?)
- A couple of fixes for the Shadow super should help with not getting flingged away from the map (although the bug is not 100% fixed yet)
- Shadows super pop will now accually turn off after the song ends (unless if you use your super again while it is still popped, in which case this bug fix is useless)

Honest im suprised you care enough to read this.
